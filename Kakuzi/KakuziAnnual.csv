THERE BEING NO OTHER BUSINESS, THE CHAIRMAN DECLARED THE MEETING CLOSED AT 12.50 P.M. (EAT) AND URGED THE MEMBERS TO TAKE CARE AND BE SAFE DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. Confirmed Date Chairman 6 Kakuzi Plc Chairman�s Statement For the year ended 31 December 2021 RESULTS The year saw the group post reduced earnings due to lower avocado production and prices. The lower production was due to the avocado orchards entering their bi-annual offseason bearing cycle which results in a large crop of avocados in one year, followed by a small crop the following year. We, however, experienced greater earnings from macadamia sales during the year as a result of increased yields from our young orchards. Product diversification and value addition remain key investment areas to enhanced stakeholder value and our continued commitment to these is critical for the long term. At the field level, our Hass avocado volumes were lower than the previous year by 17.5% as the orchards entered a low production year. The revenue decline was also compounded by a fall in the European market price due to a higher fruit supply from Peru and Columbia. Avocado production volumes were lower than in 2020, and we could not meet all of our customers� orders. However, it is instructive to note that the Kakuzi order book from the international markets was far more than we could supply, signifying continued market confidence and trust in our products. Last year's trading performance recorded greater profits from macadamia. Notably, macadamia sales increased to 513 tons from 320 tons in 2020. As the young macadamia orchards mature, we anticipate these volumes growing. Tea earnings have marginally increased from improved market prices but the growth in Kenya tea production and supply remains of concern. Our Blueberry production is still at a pilot trial stage, although with each year, the bushes are growing in size, which leads to higher production volumes. Blueberry production in Kenya is in its infancy, and we have a long way to go to fully appreciate the potential of this crop for Kakuzi and the Nation. We believe that this is a very high potential product within our portfolio, and remain optimistic of Blueberry production as one of our diversification strategy key pillars. DIVIDEND Your board recommends an increase in the dividend per share to Shs 22.00 compared to Shs 18.00 per share in 2020. OVERVIEW Over the year, the international avocado and macadamia markets were negatively influenced by the COVID19 pandemic, resulting in less consumer activity and from increased supply from other origins in the European avocado market. Within the avocado orchards we have stepped up canopy management strategies on the mature avocado crop to mitigate the bearing cycles risk. Such initiates along with field expansion (planting of new seedlings) should help to maintain production volumes at consistent levels. Currently, we have established a thriving new but immature avocado development area (about 373 hectares), with production expected in the coming seasons. Land preparation for another new Avocado development is also underway in an area previously under pineapple production. Last year, we also commenced planning and field preparation for new macadamia orchards, with establishment due to begin in the third Quarter of 2022. This will also be on land previously under pineapple cultivation. 7 Kakuzi Plc Chairman�s Statement (continued) For the year ended 31 December 2021 OVERVIEW (continued) Our recent investments in the latest colour sorting technology in the macadamia Cracking facility is designed to increase the factory�s capacity whilst at the same time producing a high-quality product. The investment in technology for food processing is paying dividends at the post-harvest and value addition level. This year, we intend to step up such investments as we explore local retail sales and supplies to the medium to large Hotel/Restaurant/Caf� (HORECA) market. We have also integrated state-of-the-art irrigation systems at field production level, fed from our own rainwater harvesting catchment dams. The efficient use of irrigation and maximising water catchments at Kakuzi are vital components of our sustainability strategy. Exciting opportunities are also emerging from our animal feed and livestock operations. We believe that producing affordable good, quality hay and diversifying our meat production to include goats will strengthen this section of our business. We believe that it is no longer acceptable to talk about being carbon net-zero; we must farm in a manner that captures atmospheric carbon into our soils to grow our plants. Sustainable traditional agricultural techniques have long been practised in our Country; however, given today's populations the use of technology and science to create the 'sustainable farming handbook' of the future is essential. Since 2018 Kakuzi has been working with the Carbon Trust in the UK to set ourselves a strict reporting criterion to measure our Carbon footprint. The preservation of agricultural soils, the conservation of water, the enhancement of natural watersheds and catchments must be combined with many other elements if we are going to future proof our farming. Our strategic plans are now heavily focused on how Kakuzi operationalises these vital elements into our business. WORLD-CLASS Within the last financial year, we made history as the first group in sub-Sahara Africa to establish a functional Independent Human Rights Advisory Committee (IHRAC) benchmarked against the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The IHRAC chaired by former Attorney General Prof Githu Muigai provides independent Human Rights advice to the Board, effectively enhancing our corporate governance standards. In appointing the IHRAC, Kakuzi joined a growing list of globally focused institutions� progressively adopting the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. As a key operations pillar, Kakuzi has also established a world-class Operational Level Grievance Mechanism (OGM) fully aligned to the UN Principles of Business and Human Rights. The Kakuzi OGM is a systematic and transparent process for receiving, investigating, and addressing group-related grievances. Kakuzi�s OGM is called SIKIKA, which in Kiswahili means �be heard�. The establishment of SIKIKA and the committees and guiding mechanisms surrounding it has been widely welcomed and endorsed by international and national institutions. We believe this is what progressive businesses need to do to strengthen their relationships with stakeholders and demonstrate our commitments to do the right thing. Kakuzi was also the first agricultural counter player at the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) to release its Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) report in December 2020. The latest Kakuzi ESG report aptly titled 'Future-proofing agriculture' confirms that, your group is an intergrated part of the surrounding community. The ESG report represents our holistic approach to measuring our Economic, Social and Environmental impact across our business. Economic empowerment of smallholder avocado farmers has been a flagship project of Kakuzi for many years. Again this year, we were able to pay farmers who supplied this program the equivalent of 87% of the international net market price. 8 Kakuzi Plc Chairman�s Statement (continued) For the year ended 31 December 2021 OPERATIONS Throughout the year we continued to adhere to COVID-19 protocols with considerable expenditure on providing the correct safety measures in our work and living spaces. Working closely with the Ministry of Health, our clinical service team provided over 4,000 vaccinations through our clinics to both employees and community members. Logistics both nationally and internationally came under some strain. Still, due to the dedicated service of the Government Agencies involved in exporting fresh produce, the impact on our operations was not significant. Good rainfall throughout the year allowed our 19 dams to fill providing us with adequate water resources. Our micro-jet irrigation systems now cover over 1,363 ha of avocado and macadamia orchards. As our operations expand, we will continue recruiting and training more graduate managers. A key component of our operations is our Management Training (MT) program which aims to mentor and nurture University graduates to assume leadership positions in an equal opportunity environment. We have already advertised several management trainee opportunities this financial year with a positive response. Within our revenue diversification strategy, we will continue to develop a range of additional value-added consumer products for the domestic and regional markets on a priority basis. Such products include a frozen blueberry range and consumer pack; high-quality roasted macadamia snacks to be sold in local supermarkets and greengrocery retail stores as we continue developing strategic partnerships. CORPORATE SOCIAL INVESTMENT (CSI) AND SUSTAINABILITY A firm commitment to our corporate citizenship role continues to find expression in our constructive engagement with various stakeholders, including our employees, workers union, local communities, avocado smallholder growers, National Government, County Government, civil society and international bodies. The overarching objective of these engagements is to ensure that we carry out our business ethically and sustainably. To measure our progress against our environmental and social responsibilities, Kakuzi has focused on six of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG's) which is well covered in our ESG report. Whilst we accept the importance of all seventeen SDG's we feel that these six best capture our operational needs and aspirations and those of our wider community. An integral part of our sustainability initiatives is measuring our carbon footprint to monitor and control our carbon emissions.

(EAT) BUT THE VOTING PROCESS CONTINUED AND CLOSED AT 2.00 P.M. (EAT). Confirmed ____________________________________ Date _______________________________ Chairman 5 Kakuzi Plc Chairman�s Statement For the year ended 31 December 2020 RESULTS The Company achieved robust results for the year, despite the uncertainty in our main sales markets caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic, with a pre-tax profit of Shs 848 million against Shs 1,014 million last year. Both avocado and macadamia export volumes were higher than 2019 but these were not sufficient to mitigate a significant reduction of 34% in the price of avocados. The market prices in 2019 were at record levels whilst 2020�s prices were more in line with medium term average. The contribution to the overall results by macadamia and sales of wood products was encouraging and reflects the benefits of having a diversified product portfolio. The significant increase in tea production in Kenya (569 million kg v 458 million kg in 2019) has impacted negatively on price levels and consequently the profitability for this crop. The results also include the cost of the Company defending itself from a UK law firm who wished to bring Kakuzi into the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom. As previously announced, Kakuzi was dropped as a party to the UK proceedings in July 2020. DIVIDEND Cash reserves are strong and we remain in a good position to meet our strategic goals. Your Board recommends an increase in the dividend per share to Shs 18.00, compared to Shs 14.00 in 2019. OVERVIEW Notwithstanding the current challenges, our development strategies remain on track, not only to complete our agricultural expansions but also to continue our sustainability journey. I am proud to have launched our first ever Environment, Social, Governance Report, titled �Our steps towards sustainability and responsibility.� This report provides a fantastic insight into our operations and specifically our commitment to upholding various United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Our agricultural operations performed well despite the challenging environment caused by the Pandemic. The operations were all modified to incorporate social distancing measures, the wearing of face masks and frequent hand cleaning as well as people working from home wherever possible. Despite these challenges we were still able to produce, process and deliver our products to the market with little disruption. For this we are extremely grateful to all our employees for their commitment and dedication during these difficult times. It is important to also thank the many National and County Government bodies which worked tirelessly to allow businesses like ours to keep on running, providing employment and contributing positively to the economy. We were also able to continue with our economic empowerment commitment to the many small holders who we purchase fruit from. A total of Ksh 58 million (85% of the net returns) was paid out to farmers in December 2020. All markets have been impacted by the Pandemic but given the significant developments in vaccines and their roll out we hope that 2021 will see a more stable situation develop, however these dynamics are almost impossible to predict. OPERATIONS The Pandemic created significant disruption in our main European markets with the almost complete closure of the Food Service sector. Despite this, demand for avocados remained resilient through the retail sector and was able to absorb the very high volumes which arrived in Europe from all origins, albeit at reduced price levels. On the back of exceptionally high rainfall our avocado export volumes were 27% up on 2019. Cold chain logistics also operated well during the season despite the enormous challenges that the Pandemic placed on these at times. 6 Kakuzi Plc Chairman�s Statement (continued) For the year ended 31 December 2020 OPERATIONS (continued) Macadamia exports continue to grow as the orchards mature and were 30% greater than 2019. Demand for macadamia was however negatively impacted by the Pandemic with our key markets experiencing a considerable downturn in sales. It is likely that the impact of this will be felt for a period of time to come while the international markets absorb the high kernel stocks created by these reduced sales. Local sales of wood products, blueberries and beef were reasonable in the year. There is a growing demand for super foods, such as blueberries, within the East African market and we will continue to explore this opportunity in the coming year. Another strong performance was recorded by our forestry department. The demand for sustainably grown timber and poles is high which is encouraging and demonstrates the importance of sustainable forestry resources for Kenya. Our arable operations produced a significant amount of quality hay, predominately for local dairy farmers, with demand out stripping supply. We will continue to expand these plantings to keep up with this demand. On the downside however, beef and other wood product sales were inevitably disrupted by the Pandemic as customer numbers for both our butchery and our other sales outlets fell. Tea prices again were under severe pressure as record volumes were produced and exported from Kenya. GOVERNANCE The allegations which have received wide media coverage over the last 6 months were shocking to us all and as stated previously, these are not matters which we take lightly. As stated in October 2020, Kakuzi began the development of an Operational-Level Grievance Mechanism (OGM) to enhance the timely and sensitive resolution to grievances that any of our employees or stakeholders may have with Kakuzi. The OGM will be fully compliant with UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and will be a fair, transparent and independent means to resolve any complaints of personal injuries connected to Kakuzi's operations. The OGM is being developed in extensive consultation with local communities. An independent, internationally recognized Human Rights consultancy organization will take the lead on this. In addition, Kakuzi has engaged independent experts to conduct a comprehensive Human Rights Impact Assessment of Kakuzi's operations, so that local communities and commercial partners can have confidence in Kakuzi's commitment to, and attainment of, the highest standards of business and Human Rights. The Board is well advanced in establishing a high level Independent Human Rights Advisory Committee (IHRAC) whose role will be to provide independent advice to the Board on matters relating to Human Rights and governance structures. We believe the combination of all these measures is a clear demonstration of our commitment to adopt the highest standards possible in our operations. CORPORATE SOCIAL INVESTMENT (CSI) AND SUSTAINABILITY Our commitment to ethical and sustainable production of quality agricultural products continues and we thank all of our employees, surrounding communities, development partners and all the other stakeholders for their continued support. Kakuzi is a signatory to UN Women with a view to supporting the principles of women empowerment. In addition, we continue to have a mutually beneficial membership to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) whose principles on Human Rights, Environment, Labour relations and Anti-corruption are reflected in our CSI activities. As stated in our Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) report our focus is on six of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG�s), to include; Good Health and Wellbeing, Quality Education, Gender Equality, Clean Water and Sanitation, Decent Work and Economic Growth and on Climate Action. 7 Kakuzi Plc Chairman�s Statement (continued) For the year ended 31 December 2020 CORPORATE SOCIAL INVESTMENT (CSI) AND SUSTAINABILITY (continued) With respect to the goals regarding Quality Education for all, we have invested in various learning facilities through the refurbishing of classrooms, constructing sanitation blocks, provision of school desks and the installation of clean drinking water projects for learners. To assist our employee�s children when the schools were closed, we purchased radios which allowed them to access education through the school radio programs broadcasted by The Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development. In line with our commitment to Gender Equality our programs on the Sexual Harassment Awareness Reporting and Prevention (SHARP) and our menstrual hygiene program, Tabasamu, have featured strongly in our training programs for all employees as well as our donation initiatives to community members. Kakuzi also won the 2020 prestigious international SEDEX Award for the best Health and Safety programs of all the suppliers world-wide accredited under this scheme. https://www.sedex.com/winners-of-the-sedex-responsible-business-awards-announced/ Expanding our community linkages is of great importance to our operations. To this end we contracted three Community Liaison Officers to enhance our communication links between the community and the Company. We have received positive feedback in this regard. In keeping with the Company�s principles, we reacted to the COVID-19 Pandemic in various ways from establishing measures to protect our employees to strengthening our community support strategies. Such initiatives included providing ICU beds, medical monitors, medical equipment to the County Government hospital, food donations to the needy, the provision of more school desks to allow for better social distancing in numerous schools and providing clean water for hand washing in many trading centres. To protect our employees, the Company instituted a comprehensive daily health screening system as well as providing sanitisers, hand washing facilities and face masks in all of our work settings. These measures remain in place. STRATEGIC GOALS & DEVELOPMENTS The income diversification strategy is now beginning to show clear results. Avocados, macadamia nuts and wood products are all strong contributors to the business performance. We hope in time that the blueberry venture will add a fourth component to this strategy. During the year we continued with our avocado plantings with an additional 85 ha planted. Irrigation developments in both macadamia and avocados were undertaken which is a key part of our strategy to mitigate the risk of adverse weather. The upgraded avocado pack house was also successfully commissioned which now doubles our processing capacity and will be sufficient to cope with increasing crop levels for many years to come. Exploring the use of new technology is also of key importance in our macadamia cracking facility to ensure the highest standards of products are packed. We are looking to diversify our livestock operations through a combination of beef cattle and goat production to answer the demands of many local businesses surrounding our operations. Goat rearing will be trialled in 2021 and if successful will be expanded. Our small holder avocado economic empowerment program is yielding good results and this will continue with the objective of getting greater market access for this fruit. Training and technology transfer is key and our staff are keenly focused on this task. For Kenya to correctly take its position as a world leader in avocado production we must continue to train farmers on what the markets demand from them. STAFF Our commitment to developing staff at all levels continues. As our operations grow, so does our need for skilled graduates to manage and provide innovation to our practices. We continue to recruit and develop our staff to meet the challenges of the complex operations at Kakuzi and as these operations grow they bring much needed employment opportunities for our surrounding communities. On average last year we employed 2,600 people per day which amounted to 750,000 employee days in the year. 8 Kakuzi Plc Chairman�s Statement (continued) For the year ended 31 December 2020 STAFF (continued) To assist in protecting our workforce from COVID-19, we employ a team of 13 Public Health Officers who on a daily basis are tasked to interact with workers, perform health checks, and provide invaluable advice on the compliance with public health regulations within all the Company�s housing and processing units. I would like to thank the whole team for their efforts especially in keeping all of our employees as safe as they could be during this difficult time. BOARD ANNOUNCMENTS As announced on the 1st November 2020, Mr Nicholas Ng�ang�a was appointed Chairman of the Board taking over from Mr Graham Mclean who stepped down from this position after 4 years but will continue his membership of the Board as a non-executive Director. We would like to thank Mr Mclean sincerely for his wise and able leadership over the years. We were also fortunate to welcome Dr John Kimani as a new member of the Board.

The earning per Share increased from Shs 24.57 to Shs 36.40. Profitability within the tea operations continued to reflect the difficult trading conditions and significant inflationary pressure on labour and other production costs. Kakuzi continues to develop its Core Crop Strategy in line with the Group�s long-term objectives. DIVIDEND Kakuzi�s cashflow and balance sheet remain strong and in a good position with which to continue its strategic investment plans. The Directors have recommended a dividend of Shs 14.00 per share compared with Shs 9.00 per share in 2018. OVERVIEW Kakuzi�s commitment to its custodial philosophy remains a prime focus as does developing its agricultural strategy i.e. the diversification of its income stream and the continued expansion of both the avocado and macadamia footprints. The future sustainability and improvement of its operations and water resources, as well as the wellbeing of its employees, forms the very foundation of the Company�s daily activities. Not least, supporting local communities through economic empowerment, health, education, environmental, water and sanitation initiatives. Kakuzi�s avocado smallholder empowerment programme paid out Shs 93 million (85% of the net returns) to individual farmers and smallholder groups who supplied fruit last year. Agriculture at Kakuzi continues to perform well in Kenya�s current business climate. Despite global political uncertainty, climate change, and volatile commodity markets, the Company�s diverse cropping portfolio and commitment to environment sustainability remain the basis of its commercial objectives. The international markets within which Kakuzi operates are very uncertain as a result of the ongoing pandemic COVID 19 and the supply and demand dynamics are unclear for 2020, making future projections uncertain. OPERATIONS The dry conditions experienced at the beginning of the year seriously affected Kakuzi�s avocado crop resulting in a decline in yield. However, a global drop in avocado volumes in comparison to 2018, meant an undersupplied market which resulted in excellent prices for most of the season. The macadamia market held firm as a result of lower than anticipated volumes from Australia and sustained demand from China. Avocado export production was down 45% on 2018 - a total of 1.56 million cartons were shipped. Market demand in EU countries continued at unprecedented levels with excellent prices being achieved, however, Kenya�s reputation as an origin for quality fruit remains undermined by the export of immature fruit. Logistics improved this year with few delays and no material insurance claims. Kakuzi continues to focus on producing quality fruit as well as its orchard expansion both in terms of size and variety. Macadamia production was up by 37% on 2018 despite the dry conditions throughout the year. Our products performed well in the market with this being the first year of marketing our product through Green and Gold Macadamias (www.greenandgoldmacadamias.com) who bring with them a wealth of macadamia marketing experience and customer access to a stable, quality supply of processed macadamia. 6 Kakuzi Plc Chairman�s Statement (continued) For the year ended 31 December 2019 OPERATIONS (continued) Market prices remained firm and in line with last year although Kakuzi�s final selling price was down about 6% as a result of a higher proportion of smaller and commercial grades sold. Kakuzi�s forestry operations saw a slight decline in sales of treated poles although sawn timber sales were up on the previous year on the back of firm demand. Sales from Kakuzi�s roadside shop continue to do well. In terms of Kakuzi�s livestock, herd numbers were maintained at an average head count of 4,400 throughout the year and considering the dry weather experienced in the first quarter, sales recovered remarkably in the second half of the year to levels slightly above 2018. Tea prices were under severe pressure throughout the year due to significant �carried forward� stocks from 2018�s record production that remained in the market. In Nandi Hills, a final agreement was reached with KPAWU on the outstanding CBAs between 2014 and 2019, and payments to employees were completed. The 10 Ha blueberry operation was established on Kakuzi during the first quarter of the year and the imported plants have grown well and produced a small crop in the last quarter; the majority of which was sold locally. A trial export shipment of a small amount was successfully completed. GOVERNANCE Kakuzi is committed to ensuring that the business is run in a professional, transparent and equitable manner so as to protect and enhance its value for all stakeholders. Kakuzi undertook its second governance audit during the year in line with the Capital Markets Authority requirement. The Auditor�s Report can be found on Page 21 of this Annual Report. In keeping with good Corporate Governance compliance, a Board evaluation process and further training sessions were conducted during the year. We continue to note the Governance auditors� recommendations and are pleased with their positive audit findings. CORPORATE SOCIAL INVESTMENT (CSI) AND SUSTAINABILITY Kakuzi continues to work hard towards achieving its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through inhouse schemes such as indigenous forest enrichment and wetland initiatives, and we remain steadfast in our support of local communities through economic empowerment initiatives, agricultural training programmes, environmental conservation schemes (such as tree planting), water sanitation, and with basic health and education needs (the provision of desks and computers). The Company�s CSI specifically works with SDGs relating to good health and wellbeing, quality education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, decent work and economic growth, and Climate action. Kakuzi�s commitment to developing community avocado farming continues in earnest through its agricultural extension services. Social media-based training programmes have been developed and numerous training programmes with farmers took place on good agricultural practices. With the increased level of new plantings by smallholder farmers, it is critical that we spend time and effort improving farmers� knowledge of the market criteria for their fruit. Growing quality fruit which meet international standards is essential to maximise the returns and to prevent this fruit from simply being ignored in weak markets. Kakuzi continues to engage with various social partners and stakeholders and is actively involved with government offices, local administration, Civil Society Organisations and Non-Governmental Organisations, in particular, the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR). During 2019, Kakuzi became a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and is in the final stages of completing its application to join the United Nations Women in support of the principles of women empowerment. 7 Kakuzi Plc Chairman�s Statement (continued) For the year ended 31 December 2019 CORPORATE SOCIAL INVESTMENT (CSI) AND SUSTAINABILITY (continued) Our commitment to the UNGC�s principles on Human Rights, Environment, Labour relations and Anticorruption is reflected in our CSI activities. Our Sexual Harassment Awareness Reporting and Prevention (SHARP) Programme continued to have positive impact at the workplace and has now been extended to the surrounding community. SHARP was featured by UNGC and UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) at the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD25) held in Nairobi in 2019. An education campaign was launched through our SAASA (Stop Alcohol and Substance Abuse) program; it is aimed at educating the youth, our employees and the general community on the dangers posed by these products. SAASA feeds directly to Kakuzi�s mental health programme which has an additional focus on counselling, stress and depression management as well as promoting family cohesion. During the year we successfully underwent various socio-environmental and food safety audits including Rainforest Alliance (RA), GLOBALG.A.P. Risk Assessment on Social Practice (GRASP), Sedex Members Ethical Trade Audit (SMETA), GlobalGAP, Tesco Nurture, and Food Safety System Certification (FSSC). We also maintained our Kenya Bureau of Standards certification for all of our products as well as a Halaal certification for our livestock and Kosher certification for our macadamia. STRATEGIC GOALS & DEVELOPMENTS Positive progress has been made towards achieving Kakuzi�s strategic development goals, and the Group maintains the growth and diversification of its operational base. The Board continues to review further developments in conjunction with the Group�s strategic objectives. Kakuzi�s development plans remain in full swing with significant additional areas of avocado being planted. Macadamia new planting development will resume in 2023 when work will commence on planting the final 30% of the total operation. Irrigation developments are also a key part of Kakuzi�s strategy to mitigate the rising risk of adverse weather conditions and are ongoing for all of our cropping operations. Sales of hay and beef into the local market continue to meet good demand and play a small yet important contribution to National food security. We hope to grow these volumes in 2020. BOARD ANNOUNCEMENTS It was with profound sadness that we announced the death of Mr Kenneth W Tarplee who passed away in the United Kingdom on the 13th February 2020 after a long battle with cancer. Mr Tarplee had been a Director of the Company for 27 years and was the Chairman of the Board for five years of this period. His guidance and counsel will be greatly missed by the Board and his fellow colleagues. Our most sincere condolences go to his family. STAFF AND DIRECTORS As the business continues to expand, we are committed to the recruitment of Kenyan management at all levels. Management at Makuyu continue to show strong commitment to their operations under what can be challenging circumstances and are well supported by their finance, administration and legal colleagues in Nairobi. LOOKING AHEAD In a world that is undergoing constant and accelerating change, be this in politics, technology, culture or the environment, we must always be ready to adapt to the new challenges placed by these changes on our business. Kakuzi produces crops that are growing in global demand by a discerning population in 8 Kakuzi Plc Chairman�s Statement For the year ended 31 December 2019 LOOKING AHEAD (continued) search of good quality, healthy food products. Going forward the challenge will be to continue to produce these sustainably, in a constantly changing climate. With ever-changing global economic, political and climatic modifications, Kakuzi looks to continually adapt as we introduce new varieties of our already established crops, and, where appropriate, diversify the type of crops we produce. We are also adopting new technologies in order to reduce the energy used in the production with the aim of reducing our carbon footprint as well as mitigate against rising production costs. Such initiatives will ensure we keep abreast of global changes as well as actively invest in crops, practices and technologies in advance of any dramatic shifts. As ever, commodity prices are both unpredictable and volatile. In terms of Kakuzi�s production, it remains largely dependent on the vagaries of the weather and other new threats such as locusts which are becoming increasingly common as a result of the very real impact of climate change. On behalf of the Board, I would like to sincerely thank all staff for their continued commitment and hard work throughout a year that has posed a set of unique challenges. The Kakuzi staff have approached challenges with great dedication and professionalism which has been nothing but exemplary. The Board of Directors have been invaluable in their assistance, direction and support of management, enabling them to progress in a productive manner, and I have every confidence that this will continue through next year.

BY ORDER OF THE BOARD K R SHAH DIRECTOR 19 March 2020 11 Kakuzi Plc Statement of Directors� Responsibilities For the year ended 31 December 2019 The Kenyan Companies Act, 2015 requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and of the Company at the end of the financial year and of their financial performance for the year then ended. It also requires the directors to ensure that the Company and its subsidiaries maintain proper accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the transactions of the Company and its subsidiaries; disclose with reasonable accuracy the financial position of the Group and the Company; and that enables them to prepare financial statements of the Group and the Company that comply with prescribed financial reporting standards and the requirements of the Kenyan Companies Act, 2015. The Directors are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and error. The Directors accept responsibility for the preparation and presentation of these Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and in the manner required by the Kenyan Companies Act, 2015. They also accept responsibility for: i. Designing, implementing and maintaining such internal control as they determine necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; ii. Selecting suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; and iii. Making judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances In preparing the Financial Statements, the Directors have assessed the Group�s and the Company�s ability to continue as going concerns and disclosed, as applicable, matters relating to the use of going concern basis of preparation of the financial statements. Nothing has come to the attention of the Directors to indicate that the Group and the Company will not remain going concerns for at least the next twelve months from the date of this statement. The Directors acknowledge that the independent audit of the Financial Statements does not relieve them of their responsibilities. Approved by the Board of Directors on 19 March 2020 and signed on its behalf by: K R SHAH C J FLOWERS DIRECTOR DIRECTOR 12 Kakuzi Plc Statement on Corporate Governance For the year ended 31 December 2019 The Board and Management of the Group recognise that effective corporate governance is central to the prudent direction and operation of the Group in a manner that ultimately enhances shareholder value and satisfies the interests of other stakeholders. This statement outlines the Group's approach toward corporate governance policies and practices. The Group�s corporate governance practices and policies have been developed under the stewardship of the Board in response to evolving laws and best practices, including the guidelines issued by The Capital Markets Authority, The Code of Corporate Governance Practices for Issuers of Securities to The Public 2015 (the Code) and other global best practices. Following the issuance of the Code, the Board embarked on tracking the implementation of the guidelines and recommendations therein. The Board, in order to ensure that the Group is compliant, commissioned a Governance Audit undertaken by an auditor, accredited by the Institute of Certified Public Secretaries of Kenya. The Governance Auditor�s opinion is on page 21 of this report. This statement describes how the Group applies the main principles of the Code. The Group acknowledges and continues to consider the recommendations of the Code carefully and implement as appropriate. Areas that have yet to be implemented are highlighted in the various sections below. In implementing the Code, the Directors have taken account of the Group�s size and structure and the fact that there is a controlling shareholder, Camellia Plc. Board Size, Composition and Independence The Group is governed by a Board of Directors each of whom is, with the exception of the Managing Director, elected by the shareholders. The Board currently comprises of seven Directors, three of whom are independent non-executive Directors. Of the remaining Directors, two are executive, and two are non-executive, including a nonexecutive Chairman. The independent and other non-executive Directors constitute over two-thirds of the Board. The membership of the Board remained unchanged in 2019. The Directors' abridged biographies appear on the Group's website, and the names of the Directors are listed on page 3 of this Annual Report. The non-executive Directors are independent of management. Their role is to advise, constructively challenge and monitor the success of management in delivering the agreed strategy within the risk appetite and control framework that is set by the Board. Based on the size, complexity and governance needs of the Group, the current Board size is considered sufficient. The size of the Board has conformed to the applicable legal and regulatory frameworks. All the Directors, excluding the Managing Director, are subject to retirement by rotation and must seek reelection by shareholders at least once every three years in accordance with the Articles of Association. Any Director appointed during the year is required to retire and seek re-election at the next Annual General Meeting. A review of the other listed Group Directorships of the Directors indicated that all the Directors have complied with the Code, which limits the number of Directorships in listed companies a member of the Board holds at any given time. 13 Kakuzi Plc Statement on Corporate Governance (continued) For the year ended 31 December 2019 Board Responsibilities _ Strategy _ Acquisitions and disposals _ Financial reporting and control _ Internal controls _ Approval of expenditure above specified limits _ Approval of transactions and contracts above specified limits _ Responsibilities for corporate governance _ Board membership and committees _ Approval of changes to capital structure _ Debt financing Board Diversity The Board is well composed in terms of the range and diversity of skills, experience and technical knowledge and has an appropriate balance of executive, non - executive and independent Directors.
